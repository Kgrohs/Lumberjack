October 8th Checkpoint Proposal:

Get a landing page up - basic MVC pattern 
Model the log4net Log table entries. 
slap the entries in a table. Use ORM. 
Not much formatting at this point. 
Find out how we’re going to host this thing, pay for it(?), host it. 
Database(s) - TSQL instance(s) hosted somewhere
Permissions - app can connect to the database(s)
Generate some data with log4net
User should bit able to hit the site and see top 50 logs at this point.
Think about/Draft how the UI should look

What I actually got accomplished:

Getting the environment setup for development and server to deploy to and database setup has taken most of this "Sprint". 
I have a server set up at work, I'm using Hyper-V to manage a VM that uses Windows Server 2012 R2. I had to Set up IIS Webserver role and SQL Server 2012. 
From Visual studio, I'm running into firewall issues and user permission issues with trying to publish my web application from Visual Studio to the Server I set up

I have the Database created, but am still working towards being able to point my application at it and pull data from it. I'm hoping that once I get all of this plumbing done
the development process will speed up significantly. This sprint has given me a much larger appreciation for the environment setup that was given to us last semester..
I can see how taking shortcuts when setting things up can create a lot of technical debt down the road.

I'll likely be continually working at this until you end up grading it.
